# CrispR
 Engine for finding guide RNA's globally. This package uses CRISPRseek to generate the guide RNA's which will be handled in python to select candidates. 
 
# Requirements
R has to be callable from the command line. Likely I will dockerise this in the future. I will also add auto installs for R libraries used and the requirements.txt file to manage python modules.
